# Variant calling analysis Killswitch circuit 

Defining variants (SNPs, insertions and deletions) for a set of HiSeq samples exploring the variability in populations of *M. pneumoniae* transformed with a killswitch cassette (C5 samples) or two (C20 samples); sequencing performed at different selection passages (2, 3, 15; 2 replicates in each condition and cassette) and a pair of replicates at passage 3 were the cassette was induced by IPTG.
